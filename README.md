# NGU-IDLE-SPEED-MOD
This is a very simple mod that can increase the speed of NGU IDLE to x100. Obviously its a CHEAT MOD so please turn OFF "Submit Highscores" in the game config.

WARNING: THIS MOD IS CODED ENTIRELY BY CLAUDE.AI, IT WORKS PERFECTLY FINE FOR ME AND ITS VERY SIMPLE BUT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO FIX ANYTHING IF IT BREAKS FOR YOU.

# Installation
Download the latest x64 version of [bepinex](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) (right now its v5.4.23.4) which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.4).

And extract all the contents of the zip to NGU Idle's game folder `...\Steam\steamapps\common\NGU IDLE`:

Bepinex will set itself up the first time the game is run after extracting the zip. So start the game, then exit the game.

Then download the plugin and put it in `...\Steam\steamapps\common\NGU IDLE\BepInEx\plugins`.

# Configuration
The first time the game is run after installing the mod, a configuration file is created: `...\Steam\steamapps\common\NGU IDLE\BepInEx\config\com.asgavin.nguspeedmod.cfg`.

The config file is only read when the game starts, so exit the game before making changes.

In the config you can change the speed of the game and the hotkeys.

# Default Hotkeys

Numpad Plus(+): Increase speed by 1

Shift + Numpad Plus(+): Increase speed by 10

Numpad Minus(-): Decrease speed by 1

Shift + Numpad Minus(-): Decrease speed by 10

Numpad 0: Reset to 1.0x

Numpad 1: Reset to 25.0x

Numpad 2: Reset to 50.0x

Numpad 3: Reset to 75.0x

Numpad Asterisk(*): Set to MAX (100x)
